Community **SDRF** annotations for public proteomics datasets (ProteomeXchange and related accessions).

**Highlights:** most common organism is **Homo sapiens**; **98,575** DIA assay rows; **74,287** TMT and **381,652** LFQ assay rows; **71** single-cell, **528** cell-line, and **594** metaproteomics accessions; sample-field completeness (applicable samples): disease 39%, age 12%; all **9,945** accessions are AI-assisted (**26** human contributors, **4** named AI agents); identified fingerprints are mostly **Cursor**; **2,822** accessions have no vendor fingerprint (typical of Claude Code committed as the reviewer); **399** accessions have Codex evidence (`codex/` PR branches); **327** accessions were touched by more than one agent (most common handoff **Cursor → Codex**); most common instrument is **Q Exactive**; most common modification is **Carbamidomethyl**; **17.5%** of public ProteomeXchange datasets have a curated SDRF here; **23.3%** of PRIDE projects are annotated.

## Gold standard datasets

Looking for a known-good SDRF to point a pipeline at? A short curated list is kept for
exactly that. Each entry passes both CI gates, maps every row to a real deposited run, and
carries enough sample metadata to exercise what usually breaks first — TMT channel maps,
cell-line identity, phospho-enrichment metadata and factor-value driven designs. Between
them they span five organisms, DDA and DIA, label-free, TMT and SILAC, and 112 to 5,798
rows. The standout is `PXD030304`: 949 cell lines with per-line sex, age, ancestry and
Cellosaurus accession across 5,798 individually mapped runs.

See **[docs/gold-standard-datasets.md](docs/gold-standard-datasets.md)** for the list,
what each one is good for testing, and how to fetch and validate them.

## Known issues

Some deposits have problems that annotation alone cannot fix. Examples are a 2 KB
metadata stub named `.raw`, or a PRIDE instrument field that contradicts the raw file.
These SDRFs are kept, not deleted, and are listed in
**[docs/known-issues.md](docs/known-issues.md)** by severity (critical, major, moderate,
minor), with the evidence for each, so pipelines can skip them and curators can follow up.

## Dataset layout

Files follow the pattern `datasets/{ACCESSION}/{ACCESSION}.sdrf.tsv`:

```
datasets/PXD000070/PXD000070.sdrf.tsv
datasets/MSV000078494/MSV000078494.sdrf.tsv
```

Additional `.sdrf.tsv` files may appear in the same folder when a project requires split designs.

## Sandbox

Work-in-progress annotations live under [`sandbox/`](sandbox/README.md).
Move a folder to `datasets/` and open a PR once it passes `parse_sdrf validate-sdrf`.
CI only validates `datasets/`; `sandbox/` is exempt so drafts don't block merges.

## Contributing

Open a pull request to add or improve annotated SDRF files.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for layout rules and review etiquette.

### Agent-assisted annotation

Use **[sdrf-skills](https://github.com/bigbio/sdrf-skills)** as the primary toolkit.
Key rules:

- **Anchor every row** in public evidence (PX page, submitted metadata, publication). Don't invent sample names or file names.
- **Keep PRs small** — one accession or a closely related batch.
- **Run validation locally** (`parse_sdrf validate-sdrf`) before opening a PR.
- **Declare assistance** in the PR description so reviewers can calibrate review depth.

For agent-specific instructions see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

### CI validation

GitHub Actions runs `parse_sdrf validate-sdrf` on every PR and push touching `datasets/**`.
The validator is installed from [`bigbio/sdrf-pipelines`](https://github.com/bigbio/sdrf-pipelines) `main` branch.
Re-run all checks manually via `workflow_dispatch` in the Actions tab.
